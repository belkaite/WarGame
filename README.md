# WarGame

Classic War card game using Python.

## Project Requirements:

1. Game Initialization: At the start of each game, a deck needs to be initialized in a random order. Once it's initialized, it should be split evenly between two players.

2. Game Rounds: In each round, each player draws the top card. The card with the higher value wins and goes to the bottom of the winner's deck. If there's a tie, both cards are discarded and belong to neither player.

3. End of Game: The game ends when one a player runs out of cards.
